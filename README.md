## Hi, I’m Aamir 👋  
🛡️ Software Supply Chain • Cloud & CI/CD Security • Agentic AI Threats  
Author | Builder | Security Architect

I build **hands-on security labs and tooling** that model how modern systems actually fail  CI/CD abuse, cloud misconfigurations, dependency poisoning, and autonomous agent misuse. My work focuses on turning abstract risks into reproducible attack paths and defensible controls.

---

### What I Build
- Software supply chain security labs (SBOM, provenance, signing)
- CI/CD attack simulations (token theft, pipeline poisoning)
- Cloud exploitation paths (IAM abuse, lateral movement, data exfiltration)
- Agentic AI & LLM security demos (tool misuse, prompt-driven actions)
- DevSecOps automation that survives real attacker behavior

### Active Labs & Projects

🔐 **ASI04Lab**  
Supply chain vulnerability labs aligned with **OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications (ASI-04)**. Focuses on dependency trust, provenance gaps, and attacker-controlled build inputs.

🧬 **OWASP-GenAI Projects**  
Central collection of labs and research artifacts covering OWASP GenAI Top 10 risks, reference implementations, and release-aligned security experiments.

🔄 **ASI-04: Insecure MCP Registry Switch with Provenance**  
Hands-on lab demonstrating an **MCP supply chain compromise**, registry switching attacks, and mitigation using provenance and signing.  

🛡️ **Local Security Assistant**  
Local-first LLM for **security architecture review**. Designed for offline analysis, document-grounded reasoning, and reduced data exfiltration risk.

🔐 **Homas**  
TLS experimentation lab with **10-instance Docker Compose setup**, focused on certificate handling, trust chains, and secure service-to-service communication.

🧠 **LLM Training Assistant**  
Experiments around training and evaluating LLMs for security-related reasoning and controlled task execution.

⚠️ **Vulnerable GitHub Actions Lab**  
CI/CD attack lab covering **workflow abuse, secret exposure, and token compromise** in GitHub Actions pipelines.

🐳 **C-S Lab Test**  
Container-focused security experiments using Dockerfiles to demonstrate misconfigurations and build-time risks.

☁️ **Cloud Supply Chain Demo**  
End-to-end **cloud supply chain attack simulation**: rogue dependency → CI compromise → cloud data exfiltration → lateral movement.

📘 **SupplyChainSoftwareSecurity**  
Source material and references for the Apress publication  
*Supply Chain Software Security – AI, IoT, Application Security*.

🔏 **Cosign Repo**  
Artifact signing and verification experiments using **Cosign**, focused on trust enforcement in CI/CD pipelines.

### Philosophy
If it can be automated, it can be abused.  
Security controls must assume **speed, scale, and autonomy** or they fail.
