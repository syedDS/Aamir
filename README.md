## Hi, I’m Aamiruddin Syed 👋  
🛡️ Software Supply Chain • Cloud & CI/CD Security • Agentic AI Threats  
Author | Builder | Security Architect

I build **hands-on security labs and tooling** that model how modern systems actually fail — CI/CD abuse, cloud misconfigurations, dependency poisoning, and autonomous agent misuse. My work focuses on turning abstract risks into reproducible attack paths and defensible controls.

---

### What I Build
- Software supply chain security labs (SBOM, provenance, signing)
- CI/CD attack simulations (token theft, pipeline poisoning)
- Cloud exploitation paths (IAM abuse, lateral movement, data exfiltration)
- Agentic AI & LLM security demos (tool misuse, prompt-driven actions)
- DevSecOps automation that survives real attacker behavior

---

### Active Labs & Projects
🔐 **Sigstore & SLSA Labs**  
Artifact signing, attestations, provenance verification across CI/CD pipelines

📦 **SBOM at Scale**  
Multi-repo SBOM generation, correlation, and product-level visibility

☁️ **Cloud Supply Chain Attack Simulation**  
Rogue dependency → CI compromise → AWS S3 exfiltration → multi-cloud pivot

🤖 **Agentic AI Security Labs**  
IAM drift, prompt abuse, unsandboxed tools, and autonomous lateral movement

⚙️ **CI/CD Abuse Scenarios**  
GitHub Actions compromises, secret leakage, and workflow trust failures

🌾 **Critical Industry Threat Modeling**  
Farm-to-food manufacturing, automotive, and connected systems

### Philosophy
If it can be automated, it can be abused.  
Security controls must assume **speed, scale, and autonomy** — or they fail.
