Hi, I’m Aamir 👋

🛡️ Software Supply Chain & Cloud Security | 🤖 Agentic AI Security
Author • Speaker • Builder • Advisor

I work at the intersection of DevSecOps, software supply chain security, and agentic AI. My focus is practical security: how real systems break, how attackers chain weaknesses, and how to design controls that actually hold up in CI/CD, cloud, and AI-driven workflows.

I spend most of my time building labs, writing, and working with engineering teams to move security left without slowing delivery.

Core Focus Areas

Software Supply Chain Security
Agentic AI & LLM Threat Modeling
Cloud & CI/CD Security
DevSecOps Automation
Infrastructure as Code Security
Internal & Cloud-Focused Penetration Testing

Current Work

🧠 OWASP GenAI Supply Chain Project (Co-Lead) – Defining threats, controls, and design patterns for AI-native supply chains
☁️ CSA Agentic AI Initiative (Contributor) – Security guidance for autonomous agents
📘 Author – Supply Chain Software Security – AI, IoT, Application Security (Apress / Springer)
🎙️ Podcast Host – Helping newcomers break into cybersecurity with real-world guidance
🧪 Hands-on Labs – Cloud, CI/CD, SBOM, provenance, and AI attack simulations

Active Projects & Labs

🔐 Sigstore & SLSA Labs – Artifact signing, provenance, and CI/CD trust chains
📦 SBOM at Scale – Generating and correlating SBOMs across multi-repo products
🧪 Cloud Supply Chain Attack Simulation – Rogue dependency → data exfil → multi-cloud pivot
🤖 Agentic AI Security Labs – Prompt abuse, tool misuse, IAM drift, and lateral movement
🌾 Cybersecurity for Farm-to-Food & Automotive Systems – Threat modeling critical industries
⚙️ CI/CD Abuse Scenarios – GitHub Actions, token theft, and pipeline poisoning

Certifications

GIAC GCSA

Writing & Speaking

✍️ Writing on software supply chain security, AI risk, and CI/CD abuse
🎤 International speaker at security conferences and community events
🧑‍🏫 Workshops and live demos focused on attacker tradecraft and defensive design

What I’m Doing Now

Building security labs that mirror real attacker behavior
Researching agent autonomy risks in cloud and CI/CD
Advising startups on product and AI security architecture
Teaching engineers how to break their own systems safely

Philosophy

Security should be designed, not bolted on.
If a control can’t survive automation, attackers will outpace it.
Good security enables speed by removing uncertainty.
